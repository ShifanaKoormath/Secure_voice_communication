# 🔐 Secure AI-Based Voice Communication System

**Android Frontend + Python Backend**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a **Secure AI-Based Voice Communication System** that demonstrates how voice messages can be:

* securely transmitted
* encrypted using modern cryptography
* processed using AI models
* analyzed for harmful or urgent content

The system is built as an **academic prototype** and is **demo-ready**, focusing on correctness, security concepts, and explainability rather than production deployment.

---

## 🧩 System Components

### 1️⃣ Android Frontend

* WhatsApp-like chat interface
* Text and voice message support
* Voice recording using device microphone
* Secure transmission of audio to backend
* No encryption keys stored on device

### 2️⃣ Python Backend

* Secure key exchange using X25519
* AES-256-GCM encryption for voice data
* Encrypted storage (no plaintext audio at rest)
* Speech-to-text using pretrained ASR (Whisper)
* AI-based message classification
* REST API using FastAPI

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions (Complete System)

### 🔹 Prerequisites

* Python 3.9+
* Android Studio (Giraffe / Hedgehog or newer)
* Android Emulator (recommended) or physical device
* Internet connection (for first-time dependency installs)

---
✅Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/ShifanaKoormath/Secure_voice_communication.git


This will create a folder:

SECUREVOICECHAT


## ▶️ Backend Setup

### Step 1 — Navigate to backend

```bash
cd SecureVoiceChat\backend
```

### Step 2 — Create & activate virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# Linux / macOS
source venv/bin/activate
```

Make sure `(venv)` appears in the terminal.

---

### Step 3 — Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


---

### Step 4 — Run backend server

For Android Emulator:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

Backend will be available at:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```

---

## ▶️ Frontend Setup (Android)

### Step 1 — Open project

1. Open Android Studio
2. Select **Open**
3. Choose the Android frontend project folder
4. Wait for Gradle sync

---

### Step 2 — Backend connectivity (IMPORTANT)

For Android Emulator, the backend **must be accessed via**:

```
http://10.0.2.2:8000
```

This is already configured in the frontend code.

> ❌ Do NOT use `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` inside Android

---

### Step 3 — Run the app

1. Start Android Emulator
2. Click **Run ▶**
3. App launches

---

## 🎤 Voice Recording Permissions

* App requests **Microphone permission** at runtime
* Permission is required for voice messaging
* App safely handles permission denial (no crash)

🧪 Demo Flow — Phase 1 (UI + Basic Messaging)
🔹 Login & User Switching

Open the app → Login screen appears

Login as User A (userA / 1234)

Chat list opens → shows User B as the contact

🔹 Text Messaging

Open chat with User B

Type a message → tap Send

Message appears on the right side (User A bubble)

🔹 Switch User (Simulated Two-User Demo)

Go back → return to Login screen

Login as User B (userB / 1234)

Open chat with User A

Previously sent message appears on the left side (received bubble)

What this demonstrates

Two-user interaction in a single device (simulated clients)

Chat UI with sender/receiver separation

Message persistence within session

Realistic messaging workflow for demo

### 🔹 Voice Messaging

1. Open a chat
2. Tap 🎤 to start recording
3. Speak
4. Tap 🎤 again to stop
5. Voice is securely uploaded to backend
6. Backend encrypts and stores audio

This demonstrates **secure voice transmission**.

---

## 🔐 Security Highlights

* No plaintext audio stored on backend
* AES keys derived via X25519
* Encryption and decryption handled server-side
* Android client holds no cryptographic secrets
* Designed to demonstrate secure communication principles

---

## 🚧 Academic Scope & Limitations

* User authentication is simulated
* No real-time calling (asynchronous messaging only)
* AI models used in pretrained / prototype mode
* Focus is on **secure integration**, not large-scale training

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Enhanced voice playback in frontend
* Visual threat / urgency indicators
* On-device inference
* Real user authentication
* Push notifications
* Full model training

## 📄 Notes for Evaluators

* This project is an **academic prototype**
* Emphasis is on:

  * security
  * system design
  * integration
  * explainability
* Runtime data and keys are intentionally excluded from Git
